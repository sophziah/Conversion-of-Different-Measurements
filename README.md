ANALYSIS OF CODE: 

1. **Input Value**: The program starts by asking the user to input an integer value (e.g., temperature, length, or centimeter).
  
2. **Conversion Type Selection**: The user then chooses a conversion type by entering a number from 1 to 8, which represents different unit conversions.

3. **Conversion Functions**: 
    - If the user selects `1`, the program converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
    - If `2`, it converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.
    - If `3` or `4`, it converts between centimeters and meters.
    - If `5` or `6`, it converts between meters and kilometers.
    - If `7` or `8`, it converts between grams and kilograms.

4. **Integer Results**: All conversion results are rounded or calculated to give integer outputs.

5. **Result Display**: After the conversion is performed, the result is printed for the user.

6. **Invalid Input Handling**: If the user selects an invalid conversion type, an error message is displayed.
